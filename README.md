# rocks-and-pebbles
A word game titled Rocks and Pebbles. You are given a secret word and you must guess it correctly. 

Whenever you guess a word, you are given a number of rocks and pebbles. The number of rocks indicates
how many letters of that word match with the secret word along with its positioning. The number of
pebbles indicates how many letters of the guessed word matches with the secret word but does not
match with the secret word's positioning.
